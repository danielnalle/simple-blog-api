# Simple Blog API

## Overview

**Simple Blog API** — Just like the name, this project lets you create, read, update, and delete posts. It includes user authentication with login and registration features. You can also add and delete comments on posts.

This is my first _serious_ ✨ project as I work toward becoming a Backend Developer.
