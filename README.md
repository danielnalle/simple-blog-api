# Simple Blog API

## Overview

Simple Blog API. Literally like the name, you can create, read, update, and delete a post. It has login and register for authentication. You can add a comment and delete a comment from a post. This is my first (serious ✨) project to become a Backend Developer.

## Tech Stack

- Javascript (Node.JS) as Programming Language
- Express JS to build API
- PostgreSQL for database
- JWT for authentication
- Bcrypt for hash password
